# About Me

Hello World I am Software Engineer based in Ohio, USA. 

I started the bootcamp route majoring in full-stack development, which the tech stack used was MERN(Mongo Express, React, Nodejs). 

Much of todays work is not this particular tech stack, but the knowledge has proven to be invaluable. My goal is to become the best developer I can be. 

I am open to feedback and welcome any critiques, as my goal is to become great.

Thank you, if you read this and have a nice day.
